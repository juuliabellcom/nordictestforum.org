# Drupal Membership Module

This module provides a generic membership entity and an optional "membership provider" plugin type.

While this module shares a namespace with earlier Drupal 5/6 modules, it does not inherit any code or architecture.

### Development

Development occurs on GitHub (fork and submit pull requests there) while utilizing the Drupal.org issue queue.

This project is still very much under development and meta-discussions around future plans and architecture are welcome.
